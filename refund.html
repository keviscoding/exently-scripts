                <h2>No Refunds Policy</h2>
                <p>Due to the digital nature of EXENTLY products, <strong>all sales are final and non-refundable</strong>. Once you receive access to our scripts, we cannot offer refunds under any circumstances.</p>

                <h2>Why No Refunds?</h2>
                <p>Digital products like scripts cannot be "returned" once delivered. Upon purchase, you immediately receive:</p>

                    <li>Installation instructions and documentation</li>
                    <li>Access to our support channels</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because these items are delivered instantly and cannot be retrieved, we cannot offer refunds.</p>

                <h2>Our 30-Day Support Guarantee</h2>
                <p>While we don't offer refunds, we stand behind our products with a <strong>30-Day Support Guarantee</strong>:</p>

                    <li><strong>Setup Assistance:</strong> We'll help you get the script installed and configured properly</li>
                    <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you encounter issues, we'll work with you to resolve them</li>
                    <li><strong>Configuration Help:</strong> We'll help optimize settings for your specific setup</li>
                    <li><strong>Update Support:</strong> Any patches or updates needed in the first 30 days are prioritized</li>
                </ul>
